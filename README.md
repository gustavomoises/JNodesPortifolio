# Node.JS Portifolio

I developed the seating table module for a restaurant management portal called Table Ready. It allows the restaurant's manager to see the tables that are available and set a group party to a table. The application allows grouping tables to increase the number of seats for a larger group.

Code Developed by Gustavo Moises.

Database in MySQL: tableready (4).sql

The program is prepared to run daily, so if you want to see the reservations and waitlist entries, it is necessary to change the reservationDateTime in the reservationentries (tableready.sql) and checkinDateTime in the waitlistentries (tableready.sql) to the actual date.  I added two images to guide the changes: reservation_date_change.png and waitlist_date_change.png
